# Data-Driven-Customer-Segmentation-Using-K-Means
Customer segmentation is an essential technique in the retail industry for identifying distinct consumer groups and developing targeted marketing strategies. This project demonstrates the application of K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on demographic and behavioral data from a mall customer dataset. Customer segmentation is an essential technique in the retail industry for identifying distinct consumer groups and developing targeted marketing strategies. This project demonstrates the application of K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on demographic and behavioral data from a mall customer dataset. The key attributes analyzed include gender, age, annual income, and spending score, which provide a comprehensive view of customer profiles. The project encompasses data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and standardizing data, followed by clustering and evaluation of the results.
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), significant insights are gained into the relationships between different features and customer behaviors. The data visualization techniques, such as scatter plots, box plots, and correlation matrices, help in understanding the distribution of data and identifying patterns that inform the clustering process. The K-Means Clustering model is trained using the standardized data, with the optimal number of clusters determined through methods like the Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, and Calinski-Harabasz Score. These metrics help evaluate the quality of the clustering by assessing the compactness and separation of clusters.
The resulting clusters reveal diverse customer segments, such as high-income, low-spending individuals, and younger, high-spending customers. Each cluster is analyzed based on median values of age, income, and spending score, as well as the proportion of male and female customers. This segmentation allows for a deeper understanding of customer demographics and spending habits, providing valuable insights for business strategies. For instance, strategies can be tailored to increase spending among high-income, low-spending customers or to retain high-spending young customers. The detailed analysis and visualization of clusters enable a nuanced understanding of customer segments, which is crucial for personalized marketing and improving customer satisfaction. Overall, the project demonstrates the practical application of data science techniques in extracting actionable insights from customer data
